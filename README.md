## About 
This is a semester project for the course 'Internet Software Development' at Texas State University. 

## Skills Learned 
In this project I learned the fundamentals of fullstack applications. I learned how to create and interact with REST apis. In this project I used a node.js server with express.js middleware in order to send data from a mongodb database. Also on the backend I learned about creating sessions and implementing my own authentication for my application using JSON Web Tokens.

For the frontend I learned to create GUIs with React.js. I learned the fundamentals of working with react like components, pages, state, state management and jsx. With creating this frontend I was able to get a better understanding of working with HTML/CSS and included a CSS framework with bootstrap.
